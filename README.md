  ### 📝 Design and Assumptions
- **UI Design:** Follows a modern dashboard layout inspired by the provided Figma design. Includes project header, team members, task filters, and action buttons.  
- **Task Management:** Core focus is on tracking tasks and their progress across different projects. Each task can have a priority, status, category, and due date.  
- **Filters & Actions:** Users can filter tasks dynamically by priority, category, or due date, and clear filters easily.  
- **Team Collaboration:** Displays team members involved in a project using avatars, including an overflow count for extra members.  
- **State Management:** All task data and filter states are handled via React Context API. Mock data is used to simulate real project tasks.  
- **Responsiveness:** The dashboard is fully responsive, ensuring usability across different screen sizes.  
- **Assumptions:**  
  - The app is primarily a **to-do / task tracking dashboard**.  
  - No backend integration; all data is mocked for demonstration purposes.  
  - Users can see team members and task summaries but cannot modify tasks persistently.  
  - Designed for desktop-first experience, but layout adjusts for smaller screens.
